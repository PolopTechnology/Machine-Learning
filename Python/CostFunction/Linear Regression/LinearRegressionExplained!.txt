linear regression NOTES:

x is a independent variable. It can do whatever the fuck it wants.
y is a dependent variable. It CANNOT do whatever the fuck it wants.

let's imagine x is Time spent playing vidogames. or TSPV.
and y is sleep time.

the more x increases, the more y decreases. Since the more time you spent playing
video games, the less time you have to do stuff like sleep.

This is a NEGATIVE relationship, because y SUFFERS by x's increase.

however let's define x and y again.

this time x is eating. The more you eat the more full you are. so let's imagine
y is how full you are.

when x increases, y increases. since the more you eat the more full you are.
however the LESS you eat, less full you are.

so you probably already guessed.

in Positive relationships, they are in the same odds. When x suffers, y suffers.
When x thrives, y thrives.

Opposite way in Negative relationships. When x suffers, y thrives.
When x thrives, y suffers.

That's basically the most basic form of linear regression.
